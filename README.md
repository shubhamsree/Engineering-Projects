# Final-Year-project


this project deals with harmonic drives

The harmonic drive provides precise and specific gear systems with high transmission
ration and very low backlash. However, for a military purpose the actuated
mechanism has to provide very smooth positioning without any source of mechanical
vibrations. This project analyzed a multi-body model of the harmonic drive and the
nonlinear model of transmission dynamic was created and the harmonic drive
operation was simulated. This non-linear model will be used for the design of control
loops which avoid output mechanical vibrations of the mechanical load precise
mechatronic or military applications. By using a PD controller to improve the
transient performance of the system, such that the maximum transient error will be
approximately 5%.
